### About Me

I'm a machine learning engineer and a Google Developer Expert in AI, specializing in the efficiency-first AI paradigm. My work focuses on building lightweight, high-performance models for real-world applications. In contract with the Keras team at Google, I have been privileged to make an impact on the library, which continues to serve more than 3,000,000 developers around the world. My models on Kaggle have also gained significant traction, with over **15,000 downloads in just half a year** as of September 2025.

You'll find me working on Keras, authoring models originally built by high-value organizations and institutions such as **Google DeepMind** (for the Gemma series) and the **University of Science and Technology of China**. Having previously worked with **Samsung R&D** and **IIT Bombay**, Iâ€™ve honed my skill set through diverse experiences, but I remain deeply committed to the mission of bringing AI to everyone as the field becomes increasingly compute-hungry.

### Built Together, For Everyone

I believe in designing with the user in mind, and my open-source work reflects this philosophy. I've contributed to various ecosystems (the links are to my individual contributions to these repositories, not the repositories themselves):

* **KerasHub:** Continuing to contribute multiple projects to [KerasHub](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-hub/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aharshaljanjani) and the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harshaljanjani/models) Keras page.
* **Core Keras:** Continuing to contribute multiple bug fixes and features to the [Core Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aharshaljanjani) library (releases 3.9.0 and 3.11.0).
* **HuggingFace:** Continuing to contribute to the [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aharshaljanjani) library.
* **PyTorch:** Contributed to the [PyTorch Tutorials](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/pull/3377) ecosystem.
